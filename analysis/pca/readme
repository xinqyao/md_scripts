# How to visualize PC collective motions

1. Create a backbone topology file.

Open the 'stripe1.in' file and modify it as you see fit.
Run the file by `cpptraj -i stripe1.in`.

2. Generate a trajectory file of the collective motion.

Modify the 'ptraj.vmd.in' file as you see fit. 
`pcmin` is the leftmost PC value of data on the PC1-PC2, for example, conformer plot.
`pcmax` is the rightmost PC value of data.
`tmode` is the PC index.
Run the file by `cpptraj -i ptraj.vmd.in`.

3. Visualize the motion by VMD.

Run `vmd -parm7 backbone.prmtop -netcdf pc1_mode.nc`.
In VMD, create multiple representations. One should be for the main structure and display as e.g., white Cartoon.
Pick up the next representation, change Drawing to 'Tube' (may also set Radius to 0.0) and Coloring to be consistent with the conformer plot.
For the same representation of above, click the 'Trajectory' tab, set 'Draw Multiple Frames' to 0:XX, where 'XX' should correspond to the right boundary of the left "conformational cluster." 
Repeat above two steps until the entire trajectory is displayed. For frame segments not corresponding to any cluster, color them differently (e.g., gray).
